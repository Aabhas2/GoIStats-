# 📊 GoIStats: Data Analysis & Insights from Government of India Datasets

This project was developed as part of the **GoIStats Hackathon**, focusing on extracting impactful insights from official datasets released by the Government of India. The goal was to perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize trends, and answer meaningful policy-relevant questions.

## 🚀 Project Objective
